An application where the receptionist would keep a track of walk-in customers, to let the barber(s) know who is next for a hair-cut. It displays an ordered list of customers who are waiting overall and who are waiting for a particular barber.
It has a button to update the customer who got in chair for haircut and reorder the list of waiting customers and their Token Numbers. It also does the same update of customers and tokens automatically in 15minutes(avg time taken by a barber for a haircut)
